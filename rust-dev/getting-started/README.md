## Cargo: the Rust build tool

**Cargo** does lots of cool stuff like:  

- build my project with `cargo build`
- run the project with `cargo run`
- test your project with `cargo test`
- buld documentation for your project with `cargo doc`

## Generate a new project

To start, we'll use Cargo to make a new project for us. In your terminal of choice run:  
```bash
cargo new hello-rust
```

`Cargo.toml` is the manifest file for Rust.

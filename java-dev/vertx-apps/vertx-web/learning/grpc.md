gRPC is an open source remote procedure call (RPC) system initially developed at Google. It uses *HTTP/2 for transport*,  
*Protocol Buffers as the interface description language*, and provides features such as *authentication, bidirectional streaming and  
flow control, blocking or nonblocking bindings and cancellations and timeouts* It generates cross-platform client and server bindings for  
many languages...wikipedia

Vert.x gRPC is a module that will align the programming style of Google gRPC with Vert.x style. As a user of this module you will be more familiar  
with the code style using Vert.x Streams and Futures while benefiting from all the benefits of gRPC
